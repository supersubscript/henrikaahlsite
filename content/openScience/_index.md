We have good reason to believe that research on video games, and in the social sciences more broadly, is [not very trustworthy](https://nickballou.com/files/APathForward.pdf). Fortunately, we have equally strong reason to believe that a set of practices that fall under the term "open science" can help. 

I'm a huge believer in open science, and try to integrate its practices all throughout my work and the research communities around me. Here are some activities I am or have been involved in to advance open science:

- Sharing open data, materials, and code in all my work, both quantitative (e.g., [this scale validation paper](https://osf.io/6gmw2/) and qualitative (e.g., [this grounded theory paper](https://osf.io/mwpqc/?view_only=dfe56f8107c74a7284ba61c0dc571885) about the role of frustration in video games)
- Using simulated data for [power analysis](https://osf.io/vp7ye/) of complex models
  - [Simulating synthetic data](https://osf.io/gvdf4/) when ethical barriers prevented sharing of raw data
- Founding and co-organizing the QMUL chapter of [ReproducibiliTea](https://reproducibilitea.org), holding monthly meetings across disciplines and/or institutions about challenges to research quality
- Acting as QMUL's Local Network Lead for the [UK Reproducibility Network](https://ukrn.org), responsible for coordinating grassroots open research activities and promotion around the university
- Conducting meta-scientific research on [transparency standards in human-computer interaction journals](https://doi.org/10.1145/3411764.3445584)
- Teaching workshops on statistical malpractice, questionable research practices, and publication bias for the [QMUL researcher development programme](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/queenmaryacademy/researcher-development/)
- Writing fully reproducible manuscripts in RMarkdown [e.g., this paper on dysregulated gaming scales](https://osf.io/h9kmv/)
- Publishing open access papers, including applying for exceptional APC funding
- Preregistering both quantitative and qualitative research [e.g., this mixed-methods paper](https://osf.io/6gmw2/) about compensating for deficiencies in daily life with video games]
- Participating in team science/corsortia projects (e.g., [this paper](https://osf.io/xzfa2) in collaboration with the UK Reproducibility Network, or [this one](https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/w48yh/) on awareness of open science practices around the UK)

I hope this list will continue to grow, and welcome suggestions or collaborations that can help me grow in this area!
