  abstract: "Plants are sessile, modular organisms that display a wide variety of different morphologies between species. The shoot apical meristem, located at the very tip of the growing plant, is a primary organiser of above-ground plant architecture, being responsible for the formations of aerial organs such as flowers and leaves. The geometry of the shoot has been linked to the number of organs and the organ positioning in the growing plant, but despite this integral role, little is known about how the plant shoot achieves and maintains its shape. Here, we analyse perturbations of the POM2/CSI1 gene, which encodes a linker protein between microtubules and cellulose synthase complexes, and whose loss-of-function mutants exhibit flattened meristem domes. We quantify this phenotype on the tissue and cell level, and find that both are perturbed. However, we find no apparent perturbations in cell growth and division, whilst identifying that cell geometry patterning correlates with high-stress domains in the shoot. Therefore, we analyse microtubule patterns in the shoot, and find that perturbed plants have differential microtubule distributions, indicating mechanical differences between the plants. We simulate a mechanical model simulating resulting meristem shapes due to perturbed cell wall matrix and cytoskeleton-mediated mechanical properties, and find disrupted mechanical properties to be a possible explanatory mechanism for the shoot phenotypes observed in the mutants. Our results signify a theoretically substantiated way for the control of shoot shape through microtubule-cell wall synthase interactions, and in the broader scope, the regulation of mechanical properties within the plant. In particular, these results implicate POM2/CSI1 as an important regulator of shoot morphology, both on the cell and tissue level."
