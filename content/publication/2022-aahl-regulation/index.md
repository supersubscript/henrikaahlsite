abstract: "The transport of the phytohormone auxin is a fundamental component in plant growth regulation, and specifically in aerial organ initiation. The accumulation of auxin in local maxima in the plant shoot specifies sites for new organs, such as flowers, subsequent to the plant initiating bolting. Canonically, the formation of local maxima is due to active cellular efflux mediated by PIN1, whereas the stability of these maxima is in part mediated by auxin influx carriers from the AUX1/LAX family. Here, we analyse confocal data of five meristems containing fluorescent reporters for PIN1 in combination with a cell membrane reporter. Using combined computational and experimental approaches, we quantitatively assess the cellular abundance and polarity pat- terning of PIN1, as well as the resulting auxin pattern following comprehensive simulations of auxin transport as mediated by active and passive transport mechanisms. We find that PIN1 has abundance and polarity patterning correlating strongly with the developmental stage of establishing primordia, both in the epidermis and provasculature. Further, our model suggests that local auxin maxima can appear before clear PIN1 concentration maxima or membrane polarity patterns have formed. In addition, we analyse auxin patterns in meristems with mod- ified expression patterns of auxin transport proteins in silico, and provide patterning-based explanatory mechanisms for experimentally observed phenotypes. Our results illustrate how computational models can be used to explore mechanisms of auxin and auxin transporters, as well as their connections to organ initiation processes in the plant shoot."
