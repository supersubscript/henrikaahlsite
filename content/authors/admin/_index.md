#Oh, hello there

I am a postdoctoral Research Associate working at the Sainsbury Laboratory at
the University of Cambridge. My work is specialised in integrative methods,
combining experimental data, computational methods, and mathematical theory to
better understand how organisms grow and develop.

Beyond my role as an academic researcher I am passionate about public data, open
source, and data analysis broadly. In my free time fiddle with my camera, hike, 
climb, and spend time with my daughter.
