# </br > Hello! I'm a PhD researcher at Queen Mary University of London studying the complex relationships between well-being and video gaming, in terms of both quantity and quality of play. 
# 
# I'm also committed to making psychological research on games more trustworthy and rigorous. I'm heavily involved in open science advocacy, training, and meta-scientific research. I serve on the QMUL Research Integrity Committee and as the Local Network Lead for the [UK Reproducibility Network](https://www.ukrn.org).
# 
# I'm supervised by a delightful team: [Prof Sebastian Deterding](https://codingconduct.cc/Publications), [Dr David Zendle](https://pure.york.ac.uk/portal/en/researchers/david-zendle(127e6f28-98bb-4662-a759-369391c609e6)/publications.html), and [Dr Laurissa Tokarchuk](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~laurissa/Laurissas_Pages/About_Me.html).
# 
# I'm always on the lookout for people with similar interests and opportunities to discuss the latest developments in my field—if you'd like to discuss my work, collaboration opportunities, or anything else, please do get in touch!
